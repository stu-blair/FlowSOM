CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.10 (2018/09/18)
--------------------------------------
Add rownames to the MFI results

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.9 (2018/09/13)
--------------------------------------
 Added a keepOrder parameter to the AggregateFlowFrames function. If TRUE, the 
 cells of the random subsample will be ordered in the same way as they were 
 originally ordered in the file. Default = FALSE for backwards compatability.
 This will be especially useful if the whole file is selected in the subsample,
 in which case indices keep corresponding to the original ones.
 
 Also included the bugfix by Stu Blair to propagate the main parameter of the
 plotnumbers function to igraph.
